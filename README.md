#OpenDNS Programming Exercises

Welcome!  I was given the choice of two exercises to  to complete before my final round of interviews.  I chose **Domain Tagging, Jr.**, and after writing an external web service to perform the DNS lookup, I decided to also do **Is Phish?** because I already had the framework setup and adding it would be trivial.

Inside each folder is the code with an explanation on what I did, how to run it locally on your machine, and a link to it running on a Heroku dyno.
